I procrastinate a lot.

I find it very difficult to commit to doing work for myself. It's very easy to get wrapped up in doing work for other people, and it's just so easy to say, *"Eh, I'll get around to it,"* when it comes to personal projects.

A blog has always been at the bottom of my TODO list. I've had elaborate, complicated ideas for things I wanted to make custom that end up being so monstorous, that it gets in the way of what my main goal is: write some shit and have people read it.

I hope to share some of my experiences as a software engineer, and help a few people along the way.

This blog is currently being built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattrobenolt/mattrobenolt.github.com).

Hopefully this won't be as hard as I've convinced myself it would be.
